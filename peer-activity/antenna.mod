# VARIABLES

#CONSTRAINTS
subject to antennas{z in Z}:
	sum{s in S: p[s,z] >= DELTA} x[s] <= 1; #zones can be served at most by 1 antenna

subject to signal{z in Z}:
	y[z] <= sum{s in S: p[s,z] >= DELTA} x[s]; #zone is served if signal is greater or equal than DELTA 

#VARIANT
subject to interference{z in Z}:
	((sum{s in S} (p[s,z]*x[s])) - (sum{s in S: p[s,z] >= DELTA} (p[s,z]*x[s]))) <= delta;Â #interference should
