# Operational Research

This repository is a collection of exercises solved during the course of Fundamentals of Operations Research at the Polytechnic University of Milan. 
I hope that they could serve as an help to other students facing this subject.    


The deadline for an exercise is usually the day that follows the assignment, I write the solution in a few hours and rarely look at it again.

Please don't be too critic on English/mathematical accuracy in this repo âœ¨
